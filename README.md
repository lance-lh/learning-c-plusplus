- [x] String_literals.cpp  

* string literals are a series of character in between two double quotes.  

* string literals are stored in a read-only section of memory.  

* There are two ways to extend your strings.   
1. `std::string name0 = std::string("Cherno") + "hello";  // use constructor`
2. `std::string name5 = "Cherno"s + "hello"; // s means an operator function`

* multiple line style  
```c++
const char* example = R"(line1
Line2
Line3)";  // R to achieve multiple lines
```
* String Class instantiations  
```c++
const char* name = "Cherno";  // one byte per character, utf-8
const wchar_t* name2 = L"Cherno";  // two bytes per character on Windows
const char16_t* name3 = u"Cherno"; // two bytes per character, utf-16
const char32_t* name4 = U"Cherno"; // 4 bytes per character, utf-32
```
* string length  
```c++
#include<stdlib.h>
std::cout << string_name << std::endl;
```

* using python framework, since it is convenient to use crawler
* software Regester to pre-process
* requests package to parser html
* re to handle content

```python
import requests
# from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

r = requests.get(url)
# html = r.content
# soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

html = r.text

pattern1 = '(?<=data-title\=).*?(?=data-set-video-id)'
pattern2 = '(?<=\").*?(?=\")'

result1 = re.findall('(?<=data-title\=).*?(?=data-video-id)',html)
print(result1)

file=open('D:/data.txt','w')
file.write(str(result1))
file.close()
```

- [x] Strings.cpp

Some good references here:
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
>
> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/

```
string is an array of characters, letters, numbers, symbols
string of text
char pointer

passing string to func,  void PrintString(const std::string& string)
this is a reference meaning that it wouldn't get copied and const means we're not to modify it here

strings are immutable in the sense that you can't just extend a string and make it bigger because this is a fixed alllocated block of memory if you wanna have a bigger string you need to perform a brand new allocation and delete the old string
