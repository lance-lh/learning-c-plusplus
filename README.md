#### Operators and operator overloading  
> operators are just functions 

```c++
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

struct Vector2  // public is default
{
	float x, y;
	
	Vector2(float x, float y)
		: x(x), y(y) {}		

	Vector2 Add(const Vector2& other) const  // not modify class members
	{
		return Vector2(x + other.x, y + other.y); // other means struct parameters (x, y), use point to specify the point it refers to
	}

	Vector2 operator+(const Vector2& other) const
	{
		return Add(other);
	}

	Vector2 Multiply(const Vector2& other) const  
	{
		return Vector2(x * other.x, y * other.y); 
	}

	Vector2 operator*(const Vector2& other) const
	{
		return Multiply(other);
	}

	bool operator==(const Vector2& other) const
	{
		return x == other.x && y == other.y;
	}

	bool operator!=(const Vector2& other) const
	{
		//return !operator==(other);
		return !(*this == other);
	}
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& stream, const Vector2& other)
{
	stream << other.x << ", " << other.y; 
	return stream; 
}

int main()
{
	Vector2 position(4.0f, 4.0f);
	Vector2 speed(0.5f, 1.5f);
	Vector2 powerup(1.1f, 1.1f);

	Vector2 result1 = position.Add(speed.Multiply(powerup));
	Vector2 result2 = position + speed * powerup;

	std::cout << result1 << std::endl;  
	std::cout << result2 << std::endl;  

	if (result1 == result2)
	{

	}

	std::cin.get();
}
```
* print class-inner content to the console   
```c++
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& stream, const Vector2& other)
{
	stream << other.x << ", " << other.y; 
	return stream; 
}
```

1. use c++ `overload` feature  
2. `std::ostream` is the original definition of `<<`  
3. `operator<<` to indicate it's gonna use to overfload operator  
4. `std::ostream& stream` is the left side of `<<`  
5. `const Vector2& other` is the right side of `<<` needed to be print out 

* Error: no operator "<<" matches these operands  
```c++
std::cout << result1 << std::endl; 
std::cout << result2 << std::endl;  
```

1. left side of `<<` is a class `cout`  
2. right side of `<<` is various data types that `cout` already knows how to print out  
3. operand types are `std::ostream << Vector2`  
4. we can't do this because there is no `overload` for this operator which takes in an output stream which is what `cout` is and then an actual `Vector2` but we can add that  

Besides, here is a detailed explanation of [C++ Overloading (Operator and Function)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm)

### 2018-12-23  
#### Create objects  
> we basically have two choices here and the difference between the choices is where the memory comes from which memory were actually going to be creating our object in
​        when we create an object in C++, it needs to occupy some memory even if we write a class that is completely empty, no class members or nothing like that it has to occupy at least one byte of memory
​         stack objects for example, their lifetime is actually controlled by the scope that they declared and as soon as that variable goes out of scope, that's it the memory is free because when that scope ends the stack pops and anything that scope frame in that stack frame that gets freed
​         once you allocated an object in that heap, it's up to you to determine when to free that block of memory

* create class  
​```c++
class Entity
{
private:
	String m_Name;
public:
	Entity() 
	​	: m_Name("Unkown")  //constructor 
	{
	}
	Entity(const String& name) 
	​	: m_Name(name) 
	{
	}

	const String& GetName() const 
	{ 
	​	return m_Name; 
	}
};
```

* objects created on the stack  
​```c++
int main()
{
	Entity* e;
	{  // use curly brace to create a scope
		Entity entity("Cherno");
		e = &entity;  // when the code runs to the next line of anchor1, content of e is freed because of scope 
		std::cout << entity.GetName() << std::endl;
	}  // anchor1
	std::cin.get();
}
```

* objects created on the heap  
```c++
int main()
{
	Entity* e;
	{  // use curly brace to create a scope
		Entity* entity = new Entity("Cherno"); 
		e = entity; // when the code runs to the next line of anchor2, content of e is freed because of heap memory is freed
		std::cout << entity->GetName() << std::endl; 
	}  // anchor1
	
	std::cin.get();
	delete e; // anchor2
}
```

* `Entity* entity = new Entity("Cherno");` we allocate memory on the `heap`, call the `constructor` and this new `entity` actually returns an entity pointer it returns the location on the `heap` where this entity has actually been allocated  

* `std::cout << entity->GetName() << std::endl;` since `entity` is a `Entity pointer`, you should dereference first, `(*entity).GetName()`

#### new and delete  
> The main purpose of `new` is to allocate memory on the `heap` specially
> 
> The `new` expression attempts to **allocate storage** and then attempts to **construct and initialize** either a single unnamed object, or an unnamed array of objects in the allocated storage. The new-expression **returns a prvalue pointer** to the constructed object or, if an array of objects was constructed, a pointer to the initial element of the array. [link](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new)

```c++
int a = 2;
int* b = new int[50]; // remember new returns a pointer, 200bytes

Entity* e = new Entity(); // not only allocate the memory, but alse calls the constructor, kind of like (Entity*)malloc(sizeof(Entity) in C, but the latter one does not call the constructor
	 
delete e; // free() in C, but delete also calls the destructor
delete[] b; // when free the array memory created by new square brackets
std::cin.get();
```

#### implicit conversion and explicit  
* first case  
```c++
X x;
Y y(x) //explicit conversion
```
* second case  
```c++
X x;
Y y = x; //implicit conversion
```
> one uses a Y's constructor and one uses the assignment operator though.

> Nope. In the second case it's not an assignment, it's an initialization, the assignment operator (`operator=`) is never called; instead, a non-`explicit` one-parameter constructor (that accepts the type  X as a parameter) is called.

> The difference between initialization and assignment is important: in the first case, a new object is being created, and it starts its life with the value that it is being initialized with (hence why a constructor is called), while assignment happens when an object is assigned (~copied) to an object that already exists and already is in a definite state.

> Anyway, the two forms of initialization that you wrote differ in the fact that in the first case you are explicitly calling a constructor, and thus any constructor is acceptable; in the second case, you're calling a constructor implicitly, since you're not using the "classical" constructor syntax, but the initialization syntax.

> In this case, only one-parameter constructors not marked with `explicit` are acceptable. Such constructors are called by some people "converting" constructors, because they are involved in implicit conversions.

> As specified [in this other answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/121162/what-does-the-explicit-keyword-mean/121163#121163), any constructor not marked as `explicit` can take part in an implicit conversion for e.g. converting an object passed to a function to the type expected by such function. Actually, you may say that it's what happens in your second example: you want to initialize (=create with a value copied from elsewhere) `y` with `x`, but `x` first has to be converted to type `Y`, which is done with the implicit constructor.

> This kind of implicit conversion is often desirable: think for example to a string class that has a converting (i.e. non-`explicit`) constructor from a `const char *`: any function that receives a `string` parameter can also be called with a "normal" C-string: because of the converting constructor the caller will use C-strings, the callee will receive its `string` object.

> Still, in some cases one-parameters constructors may not be appropriate for conversion: usually this happens when their only parameter is not conceptually "converted" to the type of the object being created, but it is just a parameter for the construction; think for example about a file stream object: probably it will have a constructor that accepts the name of the file to open, but it makes no sense to say that such string is "converted" to a stream that works on that file.

> You can also find some more complex scenarios where these implicit conversions can completely mess-up the behavior that the programmer expects from overload resolution; examples of this can be found in the answers below the one I linked above.

> More simply, it can also happen that some constructors may be very heavyweight, so the class designer may want to make sure that they are invoked explicitly. In these cases, the constructor is marked as `explicit`, so it can be used only when called "explicitly as a constructor" and doesn't take part in implicit conversions.

#### ternary operator  
In fact, it is *conditional assignment.*  
`eg.1`  

```c++
if (s_Level > 5)
		s_Speed = 10;
	else
		s_Speed = 5;
		
s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? 10 : 5;
```

`eg.2`  

```c++
if (s_Level > 5)
	if (s_Level > 10)
		s_Speed = 15;
	else
		s_Speed = 10;
else 
	s_Speed = 5;

s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? s_Level > 10 ? 15 : 10 : 5;
```

### 2018-12-21  
#### mutable  

> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/mutable  

**There are two usages of `mutable`, they are:**  
* mutable type specifier

  its uage can be found in [Const](#const)

* lambda-declarator 
> **Constructs a closure: an unnamed function object capable of capturing variables in scope.**
>
> **Lambda capture**
> The captures is a comma-separated list of zero or more captures, optionally beginning with the *capture-default*. The only capture defaults are
> `&` (implicitly capture the used automatic variables by reference) and
> `= `(implicitly capture the used automatic variables by copy).

#### constructor initializer list
> it's a way for us to initialize our class member functions in the Constructors

* First case
```c++
class Example
{
public:
	Example()
	{
		std::cout << "Created Entity!" << std::endl;
	}

	Example(int x)
	{
		std::cout << "Created Entity with " << x << "!" << std::endl;
	}
};

class Entity
{
private:
	std::string m_Name;
	Example m_Example;  
public:
	Entity()  // default constructor
	{
		m_Name = std::string("Unknown");
		m_Example = Example(8); 
	}


	Entity(const std::string& name)
	{
		m_Name = name;
	}
	const std::string& GetName() const { return m_Name; }
};

int main()
{
	Entity e0;
	std::cin.get();
}
```
* Output:  
```c++
Created Entity!
Created Entity with 8!
```

* Second case
```c++
class Example
{
public:
	Example()
	{
		std::cout << "Created Entity!" << std::endl;
	}

	Example(int x)
	{
		std::cout << "Created Entity with " << x << "!" << std::endl;
	}
};

class Entity
{
private:
	std::string m_Name;
	Example m_Example;  
public:
	Entity()  // default constructor
        : m_Example(Example(8))
	{
		m_Name = std::string("Unknown");
	}


	Entity(const std::string& name)
	{
		m_Name = name;
	}
	const std::string& GetName() const { return m_Name; }
};

int main()
{
	Entity e0;
	std::cin.get();
}
```
* Output:  
```c++
Created Entity with 8!
```

### 2018-12-20  
#### String_literals   

* string literals are a series of character in between two double quotes.  
* string literals are stored in a read-only section of memory.  
* There are two ways to extend your strings.   
1. `std::string name0 = std::string("Cherno") + "hello";  // use constructor`
2. `std::string name5 = "Cherno"s + "hello"; // s means an operator function`

* multiple line style  
```c++
const char* example = R"(line1
Line2
Line3)";  // R to achieve multiple lines
```
* String Class instantiations  
```c++
const char* name = "Cherno";  // one byte per character, utf-8
const wchar_t* name2 = L"Cherno";  // two bytes per character on Windows
const char16_t* name3 = u"Cherno"; // two bytes per character, utf-16
const char32_t* name4 = U"Cherno"; // 4 bytes per character, utf-32
```
* string length  
```c++
#include<stdlib.h>
std::cout << strlen(string_name) << std::endl;
```

#### Const
> `const` is like a promise (keep constant), you can break your promise  

> For people having trouble remembering the order in which `const` keyword is to be used, here's a quick tip.
You have to *read it backward*, like the compiler does. For instance :
`const int * A;` -> "A is a pointer to an int that is constant."
(or, depending on how you prefer to write it)
`int const* A;` -> "A is a pointer to a const int"
but both are the same as explained in the video.
`int * const A;` -> "A is a const pointer to an int."
`const int* const A;` -> "A is a const pointer to an int that is constant".﻿

```c++
	const int MAX_AGE = 90; // the compiler treat it as a read-only constant

	//1st case
	int* a = new int;  // a is a pointer to an int
	*a = 2; // change the content
	//a = &MAX_AGE; // ERROR: a value of type "const int *" cannot be assigned to an entity of type "int *"
	a = (int*)&MAX_AGE;  // change the memory it points to
	std::cout << *a << std::endl;

	//2nd case 
	const int* a1 = new int;  // a1 is a pointer to an int that is constant
	*a1 = 2; 	// cannot modify the content	
	a1 = (int*)&MAX_AGE; 
	std::cout << *a1 << std::endl;

	//3rd case, equivalent to 2nd case
	int const* a2 = new int;  // a2 is a pointer to a constant int
	*a2 = 2; 	// cannot modify the content	
	a2 = (int*)&MAX_AGE;
	std::cout << *a2 << std::endl;

	// brief summary, if variable name is right next to pointer symbol *, which indicates that the content cannot be modified.

	//4th case
	int* const a3 = new int;  // a3 is a constant pointer to an int
	*a3 = 2; 	
	a3 = (int*)&MAX_AGE;  // cannot reassign the actual pointer itself to point to something else
	std::cout << *a3 << std::endl;

	//5th case
	const int* const a4 = new int;  // a4 is a constant pointer to an int that is constant
	*a4 = 2;  // cannot modify the content
	a4 = (int*)&MAX_AGE;  // cannot reassign the actual pointer itself to point to something else
	std::cout << *a4 << std::endl;
```
**There are four usages of `const` introduced in videos***  

1. cannot modify the content  
`const int* a = new int;` = `int const* a = new int;`
2. cannot reassign it to point to something else  
`int* const a = new int;`  
3. cannot modify the content, either reassign it to sth else  
`const int* const a = new int`  
4. `const` after a class method  
```
// 3rd usage of const
class Entity
{
private:
	int m_X, m_Y;  //int *m_X, *m_Y;
	mutable int var; // with mutable you can change it
public:
	int GetX() const // const after a method, it only works in a class
		// it means you cannot modify class member variables (line 8)
		// it is just kind of read-only method, it's just gonna read data from the class
	{
		var = 2; // that's ok because var is mutable
		m_X = 2; // it's not gonna work
		return m_X;
	}

	void SetX(int x)
	{
		m_X = x;
	}
};
```
* attention to keyword `mutable`

#### Generate course list   

* using python framework, since it is convenient to use crawler
* software Regester to pre-process
* requests package to parser html
* re to handle content

```python
import requests
# from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

r = requests.get(url)
# html = r.content
# soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

html = r.text

pattern1 = '(?<=data-title\=).*?(?=data-set-video-id)'

### 2018-12-18  
#### Strings  

Some good references here:
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
>
> http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/

```
string is an array of characters, letters, numbers, symbols
string of text
char pointer

passing string to func,  void PrintString(const std::string& string)
this is a reference meaning that it wouldn't get copied and const means we're not to modify it here

strings are immutable in the sense that you can't just extend a string and make it bigger because this is a fixed alllocated block of memory if you wanna have a bigger string you need to perform a brand new allocation and delete the old string
